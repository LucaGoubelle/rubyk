# rubyk

Ruby rubik's cube simulator in console

## to run

* prerequise is ruby on machine (>= 3.1)
* run `ruby main.rb`

* `exit`: exit the program
* `init`: init a full cube

## moves

are:

* `U`: move Up face
* `D`: move Down face
* `L`: move Left face
* `R`: move Right face
* `F`: move Front face
* `y`: move all cube on y axis
* `x`: move all cube on x axis
* `z`: move all cube on z axis

* use `'` after a move to turn it counter-clockwise
* use `2` after a move to turn it twice

## some other features

* helpers for solver implementations

## axis of improvement

* Change algorithms in Scrambler class
* Add rubik's cube solving system (comming soon)
